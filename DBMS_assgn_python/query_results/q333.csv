35,20460,A Cognitive Model for Visual Attention and Its Application,Tibor Bosse,"In this paper a cognitive model for visual attention is introduced. The cognitive model is part of the design of a software agent that supports a naval warfare officer in its task to compile a tactical picture of the situation in the field. An executable formal specification of the cognitive model is given and a case study is described in which the model is used to simulate a human subject's attention. The foundation of the model is based on formal specification of representation relations for attentional states, specifying their intended meaning. The model has been automatically verified against these relations.",Proceedings of the IEEE/WIC/ACM international conference on Intelligent Agent Technology,2006

35,628767,Tools for analyzing intelligent agent systems,Tibor Bosse,"When developing sophisticated multi-agent systems whose behaviors include collaboration, negotiation, and conflict resolution, analyzing and (empirically) verifying agent system behavior is a challenging task. To aid the developer in such tasks, this paper presents an approach that combines two software engineering tools - the Tracer Tool and the TTL Checker, which together record agent activities as execution traces and verify that the traces satisfy specified properties. The objective of the combined tool is to aid the user in redesigning, debugging, and maintaining the agent system. The Tracer Tool ensures that the user's comprehension of the system behavior is accurate with respect to the execution traces and provides explanations of anomalous behavior, which can be detected as a failed behavioral property by the TTL Checker. The integrated approach has been applied to an agent-based system designed to coordinate unmanned aerial vehicles.",Web Intelligence and Agent Systems,2008
35,142127,Graph-based methods for the analysis of large-scale multiagent systems,Wilbur Peng,"Multiagent systems are often characterized by complex, and sometimes unpredictable interactions amongst their autonomous components. While these systems can provide robust and scalable solutions to a variety of problems, the inherent complexity presents a barrier to their analysis, understanding, debugging and modification. In the work presented here, we seek to overcome this problem by modeling the execution of a multiagent system as a graph, which admits the application of techniques from the well-established field of algorithmic graph theory. In particular, we employ graph search and isomorphism computation to find repeating patterns of communication within a multiagent simulation. We argue, and demonstrate empirically, that the graph, even if it is too large to fit into main memory, carries useful properties, which allow these operations to be performed efficiently. We further show that the resulting patterns (which tend to be manageable in size) present a useful view of a simulation, and facilitate the comparison of different simulations against one another. This is specifically illustrated by applying a tool called IntelliTrace, which implements our approach, to multiagent models of the national airspace. At the same time, the tool, and its underlying methodology, is domain-independent, and can be used for the analysis, development and testing of a variety of multiagent systems.",Proceedings of The 8th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems - Volume 1,2009

35,139509,An interface agent for attention manipulation,Tibor Bosse,"This paper describes the idea of an interface agent that is able to manipulate the visual attention of a human, in order to support naval crew in a tactical picture compilation task. The agent will consist of four submodels, including a model to reason about a subject's attention. In a study (not presented here) a practical case study was formally analysed, and the results were verified using automated checking tools. These results show how a human subject's attention is manipulated by adjusting luminance, based on comparative assessment involving a descriptive and a prescriptive model of the subject's attention.",Proceedings of The 8th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems - Volume 2,2009
35,407427,Automated formal analysis of human multi-issue negotiation processes,Tibor Bosse,"This paper reports on experiments in (human) multi-issue negotiation and their analysis, and presents a generic software environment supporting such an analysis. First, the paper presents a System for Analysis of Multi-Issue Negotiation (SAMIN). SAMIN was designed to analyse multi-issue negotiation processes between human negotiators, between human and software agents, and between software agents. The agents conduct one-to-one negotiations, in which the values across multiple issues are negotiated on simultaneously. To analyse such negotiation processes, the user can enter any formal property deemed useful into the system and use the system to automatically check this property in given negotiation traces. The paper presents the results of applying SAMIN in the analysis of empirical traces obtained from an experiment in multi-issue negotiation about second hand cars. In the experiment the efforts of 74 humans negotiating against each other have been analysed using SAMIN.",Multiagent and Grid Systems,2008
35,44284,On the use of organisation modelling techniques to address biological organisation,Tibor Bosse,"This paper explores how the dynamics of complex biological processes can be modelled and simulated as an organisation of multiple agents. This modelling perspective identifies organisational structure occurring in complex decentralised processes and handles complexity of the analysis of the dynamics by structuring these dynamics according to an organisational structure. More specifically, dynamic properties at different levels of aggregation in the organisational structure are identified, and related to each other according to the organisational structure. The applicability of this organisational modelling approach to address complexity in biological context is illustrated by two case studies: the organisation of intracellular processes and the organisation of the circulatory system.",Multiagent and Grid Systems,2007
35,386198,Agent-based simulation of the spatial dynamics of crime: on the interplay between criminal hot spots and reputation,Tibor Bosse,"An important challenge within the field of Criminology is to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of crime. Typical questions in this area are how the behaviour of offenders, targets, and guardians, and the emergence and displacement of criminal hot spots can be predicted. This paper presents an agent-based simulation model that can be used as an experimental tool to address such questions. The simulation model particularly focuses on the interplay between hot spots and reputation. Using the model, a number of simulation experiments have been performed, of which results have been analysed using formal techniques. The results indicate that the presented approach is able to adequately reproduce displacement patterns as described in the literature.",Proceedings of the 7th international joint conference on Autonomous agents and multiagent systems - Volume 2,2008

The model is part of the design of an agent-based system that supports a naval officer in its task to compile a tactical picture of the situation in the field. A case study is described in which the model is used to simulate a human subject's attention.

The model has been automatically verified against these specifications.,Web Intelligence and Agent Systems,2009
35,128638,Modeling the Dynamics of Mood and Depression,Fiemke Both,"Both for developing human-like virtual agents and for developing intelligent systems that make use of knowledge about the emotional state of the user, it is important to model the mood of a person. In this paper, a model for simulating the dynamics of mood is presented, based on psychological theories about a uni-polar clinical depression. The model was analyzed mathematically and by means of simulations, and it was shown that the model exhibits the most important characteristics of the theories. It shows how stress factors under some conditions can lead to a depression, while it will not lead to a depression under other conditions.",Proceeding of the 2008 conference on ECAI 2008: 18th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2008

86,53893,ResIn: a combination of results caching and index pruning for high-performance web search engines,Gleb Skobeltsyn,"Results caching is an efficient technique for reducing the query processing load, hence it is commonly used in real search engines. This technique, however, bounds the maximum hit rate due to the large fraction of singleton queries, which is an important limitation. In this paper we propose ResIn - an architecture that uses a combination of results caching and index pruning to overcome this limitation. We argue that results caching is an inexpensive and efficient way to reduce the query processing load and show that it is cheaper to implement compared to a pruned index. At the same time, we show that index pruning performance is fundamentally affected by the changes in the query traffic that the results cache induces. We experiment with real query logs and a large document collection, and show that the combination of both techniques enables efficient reduction of the query processing costs and thus is practical to use in Web search engines.",Proceedings of the 31st annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2008

107,137619,The failure of mobile payment: evidence from quasi-experimentations,Kamel Rouibah,"With the increase use of mobile phone and diffusion into people's everyday life as trusted communication devices, businesses have recently begun exploring their potential as payment devices. While many mobile payments were introduced in different parts of the world, some of them were successful, and others failed to achieve their expected benefits. In this paper we conduct a quasi experiment with 175 potential users in Kuwait in order to shed light on the following two issues: Why do mobile payment services fail? And what do providers need to do to better persuade adopters to use the mobile service?",Proceedings of the 2009 Euro American Conference on Telematics and Information Systems: New Opportunities to increase Digital Citizenship,2009
107,503732,Towards an understanding of the consumer acceptance of mobile wallet,Dong-Hee Shin,"This study seeks to validate a comprehensive model of consumer acceptance in the context of mobile payment. It uses the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model with constructs of security, trust, social influence, and self-efficacy. Structural equation modeling is used to construct a predictive model of attitudes toward the mobile wallet. Individuals' responses to questions about attitude and intention to adopt/use a mobile wallet were collected and analyzed with various factors modified from UTAUT. While the model confirms the classical role of technology acceptance factors (i.e., perceived usefulness and ease of use are key antecedents to users' attitude), the results also show that users' attitudes and intentions are influenced by perceived security and trust. In the extended model, the moderating effects of demographics on the relations among the variables were found to be significant. The proposed model brings together extant research on mobile payment and provides an important cluster of antecedents to eventual technology acceptance via constructs of behavioral intention to use and actual system usage.",Computers in Human Behavior,2009

135,338789,Development of a simulation model of colorectal cancer,Stephen Roberts,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is deadly if not found early. Any protocols developed for screening and surveillance and any policy decisions regarding the availability of CRC resources should consider the nature of the disease and its impact over time on costs and quality-adjusted life years in a population. Simulation models can provide a flexible representation needed for such analysis; however, the development of a credible simulation model of the natural history of CRC is hindered by limited data and incomplete knowledge. To accommodate the extensive modeling and remodeling required to produce a credible model, we created an object-oriented simulation platform driven by a model-independent database within the .NET environment. The object-oriented structure not only encapsulated the needs of a simulation replication but created an extensible framework for specialization of the CRC components. This robust framework allowed development to focus modeling on the CRC events and their event relationships, conveniently facilitating extensive revision during model construction. As a second-generation CRC modeling activity, this model development benefited from prior experience with data sources and modeling difficulties. A graphical user interface makes the model accessible by displaying existing scenarios, showing input variables and their values, and permitting the creation of new scenarios and changes to its input. Output from the simulation is captured in familiar tabbed worksheets and stored in the database. The eventual CRC model was conceptualized through a series of assumptions that conformed to beliefs and data regarding the natural history of CRC. Throughout the development cycle, extensive verification and validation calibrated the model. The result is a simulation model that characterizes the natural history of CRC with sufficient accuracy to provide an effective means of evaluating numerous issues regarding the burden of this disease on individuals and society. Generalizations from this study are offered regarding the use of discrete-event simulation in disease modeling and medical decision making.",ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS),2007

141,38428,Inter and intra-document contexts applied in polyrepresentation for best match IR,Mette Skov,"The principle of polyrepresentation offers a theoretical framework for handling multiple contexts in information retrieval (IR). This paper presents an empirical laboratory study of polyrepresentation in restricted mode of the information space with focus on inter and intra-document features. The Cystic Fibrosis test collection indexed in the best match system InQuery constitutes the experimental setting. Overlaps between five functionally and/or cognitively different document representations are identified. Supporting the principle of polyrepresentation, results show that in general overlaps generated by three or four representations of different nature have higher precision than those generated from two representations or the single fields. This result pertains to both structured and unstructured query mode in best match retrieval, however, with the latter query mode demonstrating higher performance. The retrieval overlaps containing search keys from the bibliographic references provide the best retrieval performance and minor MeSH terms the worst. It is concluded that a highly structured query language is necessary when implementing the principle of polyrepresentation in a best match IR system because the principle is inherently Boolean. Finally a re-ranking test shows promising results when search results are re-ranked according to precision obtained in the overlaps whilst re-ranking by citations seems less useful when integrated into polyrepresentative applications.",Information Processing and Management: an International Journal,2008
141,398514,Sound and complete relevance assessment for XML retrieval,Benjamin Piwowarski,"In information retrieval research, comparing retrieval approaches requires test collections consisting of documents, user requests and relevance assessments. Obtaining relevance assessments that are as sound and complete as possible is crucial for the comparison of retrieval approaches. In XML retrieval, the problem of obtaining sound and complete relevance assessments is further complicated by the structural relationships between retrieval results. A major difference between XML retrieval and flat document retrieval is that the relevance of elements (the retrievable units) is not independent of that of related elements. This has major consequences for the gathering of relevance assessments. This article describes investigations into the creation of sound and complete relevance assessments for the evaluation of content-oriented XML retrieval as carried out at INEX, the evaluation campaign for XML retrieval. The campaign, now in its seventh year, has had three substantially different approaches to gather assessments and has finally settled on a highlighting method for marking relevant passages within documents&mdash;even though the objective is to collect assessments at element level. The different methods of gathering assessments at INEX are discussed and contrasted. The highlighting method is shown to be the most reliable of the methods.",ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2008
141,54750,A coherent query language for XML,Krishnaprasad Thirunarayan,"Text search engines are inadequate for indexing and searching XML documents because they ignore metadata and aggregation structure implicit in the XML documents. On the other hand, the query languages supported by specialized XML search engines are very complex. In this paper, we present a simple yet flexible query language, and develop its semantics to enable intuitively appealing extraction of relevant fragments of information while simultaneously falling back on retrieval through plain text search if necessary. Our approach combines and generalizes several available techniques to obtain precise and coherent results.",Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2009

154,499418,Stacking dependency parsers,André F. T. Martins,"We explore a stacked framework for learning to predict dependency structures for natural language sentences. A typical approach in graph-based dependency parsing has been to assume a factorized model, where local features are used but a global function is optimized (McDonald et al., 2005b). Recently Nivre and McDonald (2008) used the output of one dependency parser to provide features for another. We show that this is an example of stacked learning, in which a second predictor is trained to improve the performance of the first. Further, we argue that this technique is a novel way of approximating rich non-local features in the second parser, without sacrificing efficient, model-optimal prediction. Experiments on twelve languages show that stacking transition-based and graph-based parsers improves performance over existing state-of-the-art dependency parsers.",Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2008
154,495890,Unsupervised constraint driven learning for transliteration discovery,Ming-Wei Chang,"This paper introduces a novel unsupervised constraint-driven learning algorithm for identifying named-entity (NE) transliterations in bilingual corpora. The proposed method does not require any annotated data or aligned corpora. Instead, it is bootstrapped using a simple resource -- a romanization table. We show that this resource, when used in conjunction with constraints, can efficiently identify transliteration pairs. We evaluate the proposed method on transliterating English NEs to three different languages - Chinese, Russian and Hebrew. Our experiments show that constraint driven learning can significantly outperform existing unsupervised models and achieve competitive results to existing supervised models.",Proceedings of Human Language Technologies: The 2009 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2009
154,495864,Dynamically reconfigurable hardware-software architecture for partitioning networking functions on the SoC platform,Youngmann Kim,"We present an issue of the dynamically reconfigurable hardware-software architecture which allows for partitioning networking functions on a SoC (System on Chip) platform. We address this issue as a partition problem of implementing network protocol functions into dynamically reconfigurable hardware and software modules. Such a partitioning technique can improve the co-design productivity of hardware and software modules. Practically, the proposed partitioning technique, which is called the ITC (Inter-Task Communication) technique incorporating the RT-IJC^2 (Real-Time Inter-Job Communication Channel), makes it possible to resolve the issue of partitioning networking functions into hardware and software modules on the SoC platform. Additionally, the proposed partitioning technique can support the modularity and reuse of complex network protocol functions, enabling a higher level of abstraction of future network protocol specifications onto the SoC platform. Especially, the RT-IJC^2 allows for more complex data transfers between hardware and software tasks as well as provides real-time data processing simultaneously for given application-specific real-time requirements. We conduct a variety of experiments to illustrate the application and efficiency of the proposed technique after implementing it on a commercial SoC platform based on the Altera's Excalibur including the ARM922T core and up to 1 million gates of programmable logic.",Journal of Systems and Software,2009

154,492667,Optimization in coreference resolution is not needed: a nearly-optimal algorithm with intensional constraints,Manfred Klenner,"We show how global constraints such as transitivity can be treated intensionally in a Zero-One Integer Linear Programming (ILP) framework which is geared to find the optimal and coherent partition of coreference sets given a number of candidate pairs and their weights delivered by a pairwise classifier (used as reliable clustering seed pairs). In order to find out whether ILP optimization, which is NP-complete, actually is the best we can do, we compared the first consistent solution generated by our adaptation of an efficient Zero-One algorithm with the optimal solution. The first consistent solution, which often can be found very fast, is already as good as the optimal solution; optimization is thus not needed.",Proceedings of the 12th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2009

We also investigate algorithms for non-projective parsing that account for nonlocal information, and present several hardness results. This suggests that it is unlikely that exact non-projective dependency parsing is tractable for any model richer than the edge-factored model.",Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Parsing Technologies,2007
154,132941,Leakage-aware task scheduling for partially dynamically reconfigurable FPGAs,Ping-Hung Yuh,"As technology continues to shrink, reducing leakage power of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) becomes a critical issue for the practical use of FPGAs. In this article, we address the leakage issue of partially dynamically reconfigurable FPGA architectures with sleep transistors embedded into FPGA fabrics. In particular, we focus on eliminating leakage waste due to the delay between reconfiguration and execution time of a task. For partially dynamically reconfigurable FPGAs, the configuration prefetching technique is commonly used to hide runtime reconfiguration overhead. With prefetching, the configuration of a task is loaded into FPGAs as early as possible. Therefore, there is often a delay between reconfiguration and execution time of a task. In this period of time, the SRAM cells allocated to a task cannot be turned off even though they are not utilized. In this article, we propose a two-stage task scheduling methodology to reduce leakage waste due to the delay between reconfiguration and execution time of a task without sacrificing performance. In the first stage, a performance-driven task scheduler that targets at minimizing the schedule length is invoked to generate an initial placement. In the second stage, a postplacement leakage-aware task scheduling is applied to refine the initial placement such that leakage waste is minimized provided that the schedule length is not increased. To solve the postplacement leakage optimization problem, we propose two algorithms. The first one is an optimal algorithm based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP). The second algorithm is a heuristic approach that iteratively refines the placement to reduce leakage waste. Experimental results on real and synthetic designs show that the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed postplacement leakage reduction techniques.",ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems (TODAES),2009
154,504134,Dependency parsing by belief propagation,David A. Smith,"We formulate dependency parsing as a graphical model with the novel ingredient of global constraints. We show how to apply loopy belief propagation (BP), a simple and effective tool for approximate learning and inference. As a parsing algorithm, BP is both asymptotically and empirically efficient. Even with second-order features or latent variables, which would make exact parsing considerably slower or NP-hard, BP needs only O(n3) time with a small constant factor. Furthermore, such features significantly improve parse accuracy over exact first-order methods. Incorporating additional features would increase the runtime additively rather than multiplicatively.",Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2008

171,133779,A cut-off phenomenon in location based random access games with imperfect information,Hazer Inaltekin,"This paper analyzes the behavior of selfish transmitters under imperfect location information. The scenario considered is that of a wireless network consisting of selfish nodes that are randomly distributed over the network domain according to a known probability distribution, and that are interested in communicating with a common sink node using common radio resources. In this scenario, the wireless nodes do not know the exact locations of their competitors but rather have belief distributions about these locations. Firstly, properties of the packet success probability curve as a function of the node-sink separation are obtained for such networks. Secondly, a monotonicity property for the best-response strategies of selfish nodes is identified. That is, for any given strategies of competitors of a node, there exists a critical node-sink separation for this node such that its best-response is to transmit when its distance to the sink node is smaller than this critical threshold, and to back off otherwise. Finally, necessary and sufficient conditions for a given strategy profile to be a Nash equilibrium are provided.",Proceedings of the 4th Annual International Conference on Wireless Internet,2008

280,125850,Automated non-intrusive cargo inspection system using gamma-ray imaging (ROBOSCAN 1M),Cristian Molder,"Non-intrusive inspection of cargo containers has become a key issue in recent years to parry terrorist activities and to easily verify the shipping content at customs in order to avoid contraband. Such systems are mainly based on X- and gamma-ray radiography which offer inside images of the cargos. In this article we present a non-intrusive inspection system based on gamma-ray imaging called ROBOSCAN 1M. The system has a lower radiation field compared to existing X-ray systems, providing a smaller operational area and exclusion safety zone. It requires also less maintenance at a lower cost. It is also able to scan containers, vehicles, rail cars, while automatically detecting radioactive materials.","Proceedings of the 8th WSEAS international conference on Signal processing, robotics and automation",2009

289,65532,Memory subsystem simulation in software TLM/T models,Eric Cheung,"Design of Multiprocessor System-on-a-Chips requires efficient and accurate simulation of every component. Since the memory subsystem accounts for up to 50% of the performance and energy expenditures, it has to be considered in system-level design space exploration. In this paper, we present a novel technique to simulate memory accesses in software TLM/T models. We use a compiler to automatically expose all memory accesses in software and annotate them onto efficient TLM/T models. A reverse address map provides target memory addresses for accurate cache and memory simulation. Simulating at more than 10MHz, our models allow realistic architectural design space explorations on memory subsystems. We demonstrate our approach with a design exploration case study of an industrial-strength MPEG-2 decoder.",Proceedings of the 2009 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference,2009

302,492269,A four-stage algorithm for updating a Burrows-Wheeler transform,M. Salson,"We present a four-stage algorithm that updates the Burrows-Wheeler Transform of a text T, when this text is modified. The Burrows-Wheeler Transform is used by many text compression applications and some self-index data structures. It operates by reordering the letters of a text T to obtain a new text bwt(T) which can be better compressed. Even though recent advances are offering this structure new applications, a major bottleneck still exists: bwt(T) has to be entirely reconstructed from scratch whenever T is modified. We study how standard edit operations (insertion, deletion, substitution of a letter or a factor) that transform a text T into T^' impact bwt(T). Then we present an algorithm that directly converts bwt(T) into bwt(T^'). Based on this algorithm, we also sketch a method for converting the suffix array of T into the suffix array of T^'. We finally show, based on the experiments we conducted, that this algorithm, whose worst-case time complexity is O(|T|log|T|(1+log@s/loglog|T|)), performs really well in practice and replaces advantageously the traditional approach.",Theoretical Computer Science,2009

349,137047,Formalising dynamic protocols for open agent systems,Alexander Artikis,"Multi-agent systems where the members are developed by parties with competing interests, and where there is no access to a member's internal state, are often classified as 'open'. The specification of open agent systems of this sort is largely seen as a design-time activity. Moreover, there is no support for run-time specification modification. Due to environmental, social, or other conditions, however, it is often required to revise the specification during the system execution. To address this requirement, we present an infrastructure for 'dynamic' specifications, that is, specifications that may be modified at run-time by the agents. The infrastructure consists of well-defined procedures for proposing a modification of the 'rules of the game' as well as decision-making over and enactment of proposed modifications. We employ the action language C+ to formalise dynamic specifications, and the 'Causal Calculator' implementation of C+ to execute the specifications. We illustrate our infrastructure by presenting a dynamic specification of a resource-sharing protocol.",Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law,2009

356,71755,"Stable, circulation-preserving, simplicial fluids",Sharif Elcott,"Visual quality, low computational cost, and numerical stability are foremost goals in computer animation. An important ingredient in achieving these goals is the conservation of fundamental motion invariants. For example, rigid and deformable body simulation benefits greatly from conservation of linear and angular momenta. In the case of fluids, however, none of the current techniques focuses on conserving invariants, and consequently, they often introduce a visually disturbing numerical diffusion of vorticity. Visually just as important is the resolution of complex simulation domains. Doing so with regular (even if adaptive) grid techniques can be computationally delicate. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for the simulation of fluid flows. It is designed to respect the defining differential properties, i.e., the conservation of circulation along arbitrary loops as they are transported by the flow. Consequently, our method offers several new and desirable properties: arbitrary simplicial meshes (triangles in 2D, tetrahedra in 3D) can be used to define the fluid domain; the computations involved in the update procedure are efficient due to discrete operators with small support; and it preserves discrete circulation avoiding numerical diffusion of vorticity.",ACM SIGGRAPH ASIA 2008 courses,2008

While different techniques to handle these effects were developed in the past years, they require a full 3D fluid solver with free surfaces and surface tension. We present a shallow water based particle model that is coupled with a smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation to demonstrate that real-time simulations of bubble and foam effects are possible with high frame rates. A shallow water simulation is used to represent the overall water volume. It is coupled to a particle-based bubble simulation with a flow field of spherical vortices. This bubble simulation is interacting with a smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation including surface tension to handle foam on the fluid surface. The realism and performance of our approach is demonstrated with several test cases that run with high frame rates on a standard PC.",Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGGRAPH/Eurographics symposium on Computer animation,2007

Path control is then achieved using a linear (closed) feedback loop to match the velocity field obtained from a 3D flow simulation with a target velocity field. The target velocity field can be generated in a variety of ways and may include the small scale swirling motion characteristic of turbulent flows. We provide several examples of complex smoke paths to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.",Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGGRAPH/Eurographics symposium on Computer animation,2006

The interaction requirements between these processes can be complex, and the template matching coordination law of the Linda and JavaSpaces model is not sufficient. Moreover, the usage should not be limited to a single platform. Several authors have proposed coordination extensions, but besides the suggestion to use XML or RDF based query facilities, a formalization of a general and extensible space-based coordination model has not yet been realized. In this paper we present the algebraic data structures and the coordination model based on a navigational query language for the extensible virtual shared memory architecture, and show how they can be adapted to support arbitrary coordination laws by the introduction of user-definable matchmaker and selector functions. The platform independence is achieved through a language independent communication protocol. The formal specification of the data model is the necessary basis for this protocol.",Proceedings of the 2009 International Database Engineering & Applications Symposium,2009

We experiment on two practical tasks, document clustering and chat disentanglement, to which ILP does not scale. On these datasets, we show that the clustering objective often, but not always, correlates with external metrics, and that local search always improves over greedy solutions. We use semi-definite programming (SDP) to provide a tighter bound, showing that simple algorithms are already close to optimality.",Proceedings of the Workshop on Integer Linear Programming for Natural Langauge Processing,2009
399,129942,Catching the drift: learning broad matches from clickthrough data,Sonal Gupta,"Identifying similar keywords, known as broad matches, is an important task in online advertising that has become a standard feature on all major keyword advertising platforms. Effective broad matching leads to improvements in both relevance and monetization, while increasing advertisers' reach and making campaign management easier. In this paper, we present a learning-based approach to broad matching that is based on exploiting implicit feedback in the form of advertisement clickthrough logs. Our method can utilize arbitrary similarity functions by incorporating them as features. We present an online learning algorithm, Amnesiac Averaged Perceptron, that is highly efficient yet able to quickly adjust to the rapidly-changing distributions of bidded keywords, advertisements and user behavior. Experimental results obtained from (1) historical logs and (2) live trials on a large-scale advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the overall success of our approach in identifying high-quality broad match mappings.",Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2009
399,140254,Ranking-based clustering of heterogeneous information networks with star network schema,Yizhou Sun,"A heterogeneous information network is an information network composed of multiple types of objects. Clustering on such a network may lead to better understanding of both hidden structures of the network and the individual role played by every object in each cluster. However, although clustering on homogeneous networks has been studied over decades, clustering on heterogeneous networks has not been addressed until recently. A recent study proposed a new algorithm, RankClus, for clustering on bi-typed heterogeneous networks. However, a real-world network may consist of more than two types, and the interactions among multi-typed objects play a key role at disclosing the rich semantics that a network carries. In this paper, we study clustering of multi-typed heterogeneous networks with a star network schema and propose a novel algorithm, NetClus, that utilizes links across multityped objects to generate high-quality net-clusters. An iterative enhancement method is developed that leads to effective ranking-based clustering in such heterogeneous networks. Our experiments on DBLP data show that NetClus generates more accurate clustering results than the baseline topic model algorithm PLSA and the recently proposed algorithm, RankClus. Further, NetClus generates informative clusters, presenting good ranking and cluster membership information for each attribute object in each net-cluster.",Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2009

The generation of random numbers for simulations is not trivial, as the quality of each algorithm depends on the simulation scenario. Therefore, simulation environments for large-scale experimentation with safety-critical models require a reliable mechanism to cope with this aspect. We show how to address this problem by realizing a random number generation architecture for a general-purpose simulation system. It provides various random number generators (RNGs), probability distributions, and RNG tests. It is open to future additions, which allows the assessment of new generators in a simulation context and the re-validation of past simulation studies. We present a short example that illustrates why the features of such an architecture are essential for getting valid results.",Proceedings of the 40th Conference on Winter Simulation,2008

Indeed, software testing is a broad term encompassing a variety of activities along the development cycle and beyond, aimed at different goals. Hence, software testing research faces a collection of challenges. A consistent roadmap of the most relevant challenges to be addressed is here proposed. In it, the starting point is constituted by some important past achievements, while the destination consists of four identified goals to which research ultimately tends, but which remain as unreachable as dreams.

A typical approach in graph-based dependency parsing has been to assume a factorized model, where local features are used but a global function is optimized (McDonald et al., 2005b). Recently Nivre and McDonald (2008) used the output of one dependency parser to provide features for another. We show that this is an example of stacked learning, in which a second predictor is trained to improve the performance of the first. Further, we argue that this technique is a novel way of approximating rich non-local features in the second parser, without sacrificing efficient, model-optimal prediction. Experiments on twelve languages show that stacking transition-based and graph-based parsers improves performance over existing state-of-the-art dependency parsers.",Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2008

It is inspired by cube pruning (Chiang, 2007; Huang and Chiang, 2007) in its computation of non-local features dynamically using scored k-best lists, but also maintains additional residual quantities used in calculating approximate marginals. When restricted to local features, cube summing reduces to a novel semiring (k-best+residual) that generalizes many of the semirings of Goodman (1999). When non-local features are included, cube summing does not reduce to any semiring, but is compatible with generic techniques for solving dynamic programming equations.",Proceedings of the 12th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2009

Extensive experimental evaluation comparing the efficiency of the different alternatives are provided. Given a sequence of bits, a rank query counts the number of occurrences of the bit 1 up to a given position, and a select query returns the position of the ith occurrence of the bit 1. These operations are widely used in information retrieval and management, being the base of several data structures and algorithms for text collections, graphs, etc. There exist solutions for computing these operations on sequences of bits in constant time using additional information. However, new applications require rank and select to be computed on sequences of bytes instead of bits. The solutions for the binary case are not directly applicable to sequences of bytes. The existing solutions for the byte case vary in their space-time trade-off which can still be improved.",Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS),2009

524,140422,A robust hit-or-miss transform for template matching applied to very noisy astronomical images,B. Perret,"The morphological hit-or-miss transform (HMT) is a powerful tool for digital image analysis. Its recent extensions to grey level images have proven its ability to solve various template matching problems. In this paper we explore the capacity of various existing approaches to work in very noisy environments and discuss the generic methods used to improve their robustness to noise. We also propose a new formulation for a fuzzy morphological HMT which has been especially designed to deal with very noisy images. Our approach is validated through a pattern matching problem in astronomical images that consists of detecting very faint objects: low surface brightness galaxies. Despite their influence on the galactic evolution model, these objects remain mostly misunderstood by the astronomers. Due to their low signal to noise ratio, there is no automatic and reliable detection method yet. In this paper we introduce such a method based on the proposed hit-or-miss operator. The complete process is described starting from the building of a set of patterns until the reconstruction of a suitable map of detected objects. Implementation, running cost and optimisations are discussed. Outcomes have been examined by astronomers and compared to previous works. We have observed promising results in this difficult context for which mathematical morphology provides an original solution.",Pattern Recognition,2009
524,524,Grey-level hit-or-miss transforms-Part I: Unified theory,Benoít Naegel,"The hit-or-miss transform (HMT) is a fundamental operation on binary images, widely used since 40 years. As it is not increasing, its extension to grey-level images is not straightforward, and very few authors have considered it. Moreover, despite its potential usefulness, very few applications of the grey-level HMT have been proposed until now. Part I of this paper, developed hereafter, is devoted to the description of a theory leading to a unification of the main definitions of the grey-level HMT, mainly proposed by Ronse and Soille, respectively (part II will deal with the applicative potential of the grey-level HMT, which will be illustrated by its use for vessel segmentation from 3D angiographic data). In this first part, we review the previous approaches to the grey-level HMT, especially the supremal one of Ronse, and the integral one of Soille; the latter was defined only for flat structuring elements (SEs), but it can be generalized to non-flat ones. We present a unified theory of the grey-level HMT, which is decomposed into two steps. First a fitting associates to each point the set of grey-levels for which the SEs can be fitted to the image; as in Soille's approach, this fitting step can be constrained. Next, a valuation associates a final grey-level value to each point; we propose three valuations: supremal (as in Ronse), integral (as in Soille) and binary.",Pattern Recognition,2007

However, users may not be interested in all the information that the applications can produce. Using scenarios of four real-world applications that span the design space of context-aware computing, we conducted two experiments to discover what information users are interested in. In the first experiment, we elicit types of information demands that users have and under what moderating circumstances they have them. In the second experiment, we verify the findings by soliciting users about which types they would want to know and establish whether receiving such information would satisfy them. We discuss why users demand certain types of information, and provide design implications on how to provide different intelligibility types to make context-aware applications intelligible and acceptable to users.",Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Ubiquitous computing,2009

Without taking advantage of at least some of these practices, the software these end users create seems likely to continue to be less reliable than it could be. We are working on several ways of lowering both the perceived and actual costs of systematic software engineering practices, and on making their benefits more visible and immediate. Our approach is to leverage the user's cognitive effort through the use of distributed cognition, in which the system and user collaboratively work systematically to reason about the program the end user is creating. This paper demonstrates this concept with a few of our past efforts, and then presents three of our current efforts in this direction.",Proceedings of the 2009 ICSE Workshop on Software Engineering Foundations for End User Programming,2009
592,140700,Interacting meaningfully with machine learning systems: Three experiments,Simone Stumpf,"Although machine learning is becoming commonly used in today's software, there has been little research into how end users might interact with machine learning systems, beyond communicating simple ''right/wrong'' judgments. If the users themselves could work hand-in-hand with machine learning systems, the users' understanding and trust of the system could improve and the accuracy of learning systems could be improved as well. We conducted three experiments to understand the potential for rich interactions between users and machine learning systems. The first experiment was a think-aloud study that investigated users' willingness to interact with machine learning reasoning, and what kinds of feedback users might give to machine learning systems. We then investigated the viability of introducing such feedback into machine learning systems, specifically, how to incorporate some of these types of user feedback into machine learning systems, and what their impact was on the accuracy of the system. Taken together, the results of our experiments show that supporting rich interactions between users and machine learning systems is feasible for both user and machine. This shows the potential of rich human-computer collaboration via on-the-spot interactions as a promising direction for machine learning systems and users to collaboratively share intelligence.",International Journal of Human-Computer Studies,2009

Providing ways for the user to debug it matters, because without the ability to fix errors users may find that the learned program's errors are too damaging for them to be able to trust such programs.

592,502297,From spaces to places: emerging contexts in mobile privacy,Clara Mancini,"Mobile privacy concerns are central to Ubicomp and yet remain poorly understood. We advocate a diversified approach, enabling the cross-interpretation of data from complementary methods. However, mobility imposes a number of limitations on the methods that can be effectively employed. We discuss how we addressed this problem in an empirical study of mobile social networking. We report on how, by combining a variation of experience sampling and contextual interviews, we have started focusing on a notion of context in relation to privacy, which is subjectively defined by emerging socio-cultural knowledge, functions, relations and rules. With reference to Gieryn's sociological work, we call this place, as opposed to a notion of context that is objectively defined by physical and factual elements, which we call space. We propose that the former better describes the context for mobile privacy.",Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Ubiquitous computing,2009
592,140072,Like an intuitive and courteous butler: a proactive personal agent for task management,Neil Yorke-Smith,"The ability to proactively offer assistance promises to make personal agents more helpful to their users. We characterize the properties desired of proactive behaviour by a personal assistant agent in the realm of task management, and present an extended agent cognition model that features a meta-level layer charged with identifying potentially helpful actions and determining when it is appropriate to perform them. The reasoning that answers these questions draws on a theory of proactivity that describes user desires and a model of helpfulness. Operationally, assistance patterns represent a compiled form of this knowledge, instantiating meta-cognition over the agent's beliefs about its user's activities as well as over world state. We have implemented the resulting generic framework for proactive goal generation and deliberation as part of a personal assistant agent in the desktop domain.",Proceedings of The 8th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems - Volume 1,2009

Since this reversibility helps to make right decision during image analysis, it is highly desired in quality-sensitive imagery where even the minimal distortion introduced by embedding data is unacceptable. In this paper, we propose a reversible data hiding method that modifies the difference histogram between sub-sampled images. It exploits the high spatial correlation inherent in neighboring pixels to achieve high capacity and imperceptible embedding. On various test images including 16-bit images, we demonstrate the validity of our proposed method by comparing to other existing reversible data hiding algorithms. Experimental results support that our method provides high embedding capacity while keeping the distortions at a low level.",Pattern Recognition,2009

By applying the quasi-arithmetic mean-based defuzzification method and its orness measure, we extend the properties of discrete quasi-arithmetic mean with an orness measure to the case of continuous weighted quasi-arithmetic means, and apply them to the parameterized estimation of fuzzy or random variables. When facing the uncertainty of these variables, the decision maker can obtain the crisp value estimation which is always consistent with his/her preference information. Two families of continuous weighted quasi-arithmetic means with exponential and power function generators are discussed. Combining these conclusions with that of the discrete case, we can understand better the properties of quasi-arithmetic means and extend their possible applications.",Information Sciences: an International Journal,2009

704,54230,On the equivalence of some approaches to the OWA operator and RIM quantifier determination,Xinwang Liu,"The ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator is a widely used aggregation method, and its determination is usually a prerequisite step in many related applications. The regular increasing monotone (RIM) quantifier can be seen as the continuous case of the OWA operator with the quantifier aggregation method. Some approaches with optimization criteria for the determination of OWA operator and RIM quantifier were proposed. Although these problems look different at the first sight, a deeper investigation can reveal the equivalence of solutions between them. Inspired by the solution equivalence of minimum variance problems and minimax disparity problem for OWA operator, we propose the minimax disparity RIM quantifier problem and two minimax ratio problems for OWA operator and RIM quantifier, respectively. We investigate the equivalence of solutions for the maximum entropy and minimax ratio problems, and solutions for the minimum variance and minimax disparity problems of OWA operator and RIM quantifier, respectively, by a theoretical point of view.",Fuzzy Sets and Systems,2008

759,307222,Protocol Moderators as Active Middle-Agents in Multi-Agent Systems,Chihab Hanachi,"Interaction protocols are widely recognized as an essential mechanism for coordination within multi-agent systems. There is thus a need for coordination models for specifying, validating, and implementing protocols, possibly open and concurrent, efficiently and reliably. This paper proposes such a model, which considers protocols as resources and each conversation among agents following the rules of a protocol as a well-identified process. To this end, a new kind of middle-agent, called Moderator, is introduced. A Moderator is in charge of monitoring a conversation so that it progresses according to the protocol rules, and provides agents with services to ease their involvement in the conversation. This model fits the organization-centered view of multi-agent systems as it strictly distinguishes the agent-level and the organization-level concerns with regard to interaction. In addition, the paper shows that this model is supported by a High-Level Petri Net language that covers all the steps of protocol engineering: design, validation, implementation. This paper presents this Moderator Coordination Model along four related dimensions: a conceptual model of protocols, a MAS architecture, a suitable modeling formalism, and an associated development process.",Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems,2004

In peer-assisted streaming, the peers exchange video chunks with one another, and receive additional data from the central server as needed. In this paper, we analyze how to provision resources for the streaming system, in terms of the server capacity, the video quality, and the depth of the distribution trees that deliver the content. We derive the performance bounds for minimum server load, maximum streaming rate, and minimum tree depth under different peer selection constraints. Furthermore, we show that our performance bounds are actually tight, by presenting algorithms for constructing trees that achieve our bounds.",Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMETRICS international conference on Measurement and modeling of computer systems,2008

They have recently attract attention as a good model for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay networks. Existing work gives results on networks with constraints of node upload capacities. In this paper, we consider networks with constraints on both node upload and node download capacity. For such networks, we investigate the rate optimality of routing versus network coding. In general, network coding achieves a larger rate region than routing. However, for some important communication scenarios, routing achieves the same rate region as network coding.",Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE international conference on Symposium on Information Theory - Volume 3,2009

Gutiérrez,"Remote sensing (RS), geographic information systems (GIS), and global positioning systems (GPS) may provide the technologies needed for farmers to maximize the economic and environmental benefits of precision farming. Site-specific weed management (SSWM) is able to minimize the impact of herbicide on environmental quality and arises the necessity of more precise approaches for weed patches determination. Ridolfia segetum is one of the most dominant, competitive and persistent weed in sunflower crops in southern Spain. In this paper, we used aerial imagery taken in mid-May, mid-June and mid-July according to different phenological stages of R. segetum and sunflower to evaluate the potential of evolutionary product-unit neural networks (EPUNNs), logistic regression (LR) and two different combinations of both (logistic regression using product units (LRPU) and logistic regression using initial covariates and product units (LRIPU)) for discriminating R. segetum patches and mapping R. segetum probabilities in sunflower crops on two naturally infested fields. Afterwards, we compared the performance of these methods in every date to two recent classification models (support vector machines (SVM) and logistic model trees (LMT)). The results obtained present the models proposed as powerful tools for weed discrimination, the best performing model (LRIPU) obtaining generalization accuracies of 99.2% and 98.7% in mid-June. Our results suggest that a strategy to implement SSWM is feasible with minima omission and commission errors, and therefore, with a very low probability of not detecting R. segetum patches. The paper proposes the application of a new methodology that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously applied in RS, and which obtains better accuracy than more traditional RS classification techniques, such as vegetation indices or spectral angle mapper.",Computers and Electronics in Agriculture,2008

867,125439,The Vehicle Routing Problem with Real-Time Travel Times,Irena Okhrin,"In the paper we consider a vehicle routing problem with time windows and real-time travel time information. We assume the deployment of an information and communication system that is based on mobile technologies. It provides a real-time mobile connection between the dispatching centre and the drivers, allows localizing the vehicles on road, and gives the overview over the current traffic conditions. Therefore, we explicitly incorporate into our consideration the possibility to react to some dynamic events like traffic impediments and divert a vehicle away from its current destination. To solve the problem we develop a genetic algorithm and test its performance on the well-known benchmarks. The quality of the received solutions is between -6.48% and 2.08% with the average quality -1.5% compared to the best known published results. The negative values indicate that our solutions are better than the corresponding best known, i.e. in majority of cases we outperform them.",Proceeding of the 2008 conference on Techniques and Applications for Mobile Commerce: Proceedings of TAMoCo 2008,2008

The focus of our research is on employing evolutionary algorithms for the structural unit-testing of Object-Oriented programs. Relevant contributions include the introduction of novel methodologies for automation, search guidance and Input Domain Reduction; the strategies proposed were empirically evaluated with encouraging results. Test cases are evolved using the Strongly-Typed Genetic Programming technique. Test data quality evaluation includes instrumenting the test object, executing it with the generated test cases, and tracing the structures traversed in order to derive coverage metrics. The methodology for efficiently guiding the search process towards achieving full structural coverage involves favouring test cases that exercise problematic structures. Purity Analysis is employed as a systematic strategy for reducing the search space.",Information and Software Technology,2009
867,490675,Periodical switching between related goals for improving evolvability to a fixed goal in multi-objective problems,Seppo J. Ovaska,"Evolutionary computation plays a principal role in intelligent design automation. Evolutionary approaches have discovered novel and patentable designs. Nonetheless, evolutionary techniques may lead to designs that lack robustness. This critical issue is strongly connected to the concept of evolvability. In nature, highly evolvable species tend to be found in rapidly changing environments. Such species can be considered robust against environmental changes. Consequently, to create robust engineering designs it could be beneficial to use variable, rather than fixed, fitness criteria. In this paper, we study the performance of an evolutionary programming algorithm with periodical switching between goals, which are selected randomly from a set of related goals. It is shown by a dual-objective filter optimization example that altering goals may improve evolvability to a fixed goal by enhancing the dynamics of solution population, and guiding the search to areas where improved solutions are likely to be found. Our reference algorithm with a single goal is able to find solutions with competitive fitness, but these solutions are results of premature convergence, because they are poorly evolvable. By using the same algorithm with switching goals, we can extend the productive search length considerably; both the fitness and robustness of such designs are improved.",Information Sciences: an International Journal,2009

867,430487,Dynamic vehicle routing using genetic algorithms,Franklin T. Hanshar,"Many difficult combinatorial optimization problems have been modeled as static problems. However, in practice, many problems are dynamic and changing, while some decisions have to be made before all the design data are known. For example, in the Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP), new customer orders appear over time, and new routes must be reconfigured while executing the current solution. Montemanni et al. [1] considered a DVRP as an extension to the standard vehicle routing problem (VRP) by decomposing a DVRP as a sequence of static VRPs, and then solving them with an ant colony system (ACS) algorithm.This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) methodology for providing solutions for the DVRP model employed in [1]. The effectiveness of the proposed GA is evaluated using a set of benchmarks found in the literature. Compared with a tabu search approach implemented herein and the aforementioned ACS, the proposed GA methodology performs better in minimizing travel costs.",Applied Intelligence,2007
867,62792,Multi-objective UAV mission planning using evolutionary computation,Adam J. Pohl,"This investigation develops an innovative algorithm for multiple autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mission routing. The concept of a UAV Swarm Routing Problem (SRP) as a new combinatorics problem, is developed as a variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). Solutions of SRP problem model result in route assignments per vehicle that successfully track to all targets, on time, within distance constraints. A complexity analysis and multi-objective formulation of the VRPTW indicates the necessity of a stochastic solution approach leading to a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. A full problem definition of the SRP as well as a multi-objective formulation parallels that of the VRPTW method. Benchmark problems for the VRPTW are modified in order to create SRP benchmarks. The solutions show the SRP solutions are comparable or better than the same VRPTW solutions, while also representing a more realistic UAV swarm routing solution.",Proceedings of the 40th Conference on Winter Simulation,2008
867,133817,Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm for DS-CDMA Pseudonoise Sequence Design in a Multiresolutive Acquisition,Rosa Maria Alsina Pagès,"In DS-CDMA communications, pseudonoise sequence sets must fulfil crosscorrelation and autocorrelation minimization properties in order to minimize multiuser interference and improve the probability of acquisition. When a multiresolutive acquisition scheme is to be used [3] the pseudonoise sequences (PN) have to satisfy more strict constraints for achieving proper acquisition performance. In this paper we present a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to design a set of pseudonoise sequences meeting all the constraints that the receiver of DS-CDMA communication system demands. The new pseudonoise sequence set accomplishes not only the basic pseudorandom waveform properties but also the new crosscorrelation and autocorrelation features required by the multiresolutive structure, obtaining better results in terms of crosscorrelation and stability. This way a better trade off between mean acquisition time and computational requirements can be achieved regarding traditional adquisition schemes.",Proceeding of the 2007 conference on Artificial Intelligence Research and Development,2007

While many of these networks allow users to export their personal data or expose themselves to third-party web archiving, some do not. Facebook, one of the most popular social networking websites, is one example of a ""walled garden"" where users' activities are trapped.

Our framework could be applied to any walled garden where personal user data is being locked.",Proceedings of the 9th ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on Digital libraries,2009
905,141279,Comparing the performance of us college football teams in the web and on the field,Martin Klein,"In previous research it has been shown that link-based web page metrics can be used to predict experts' assessment of quality. We are interested in a related question: do expert rankings of real-world entities correlate with search engine (SE) rankings of corresponding web resources? To answer this question we compared rankings of college football teams in the US with rankings of their associated web resources. We looked at the weekly polls released by the Associated Press (AP) and USA Today Coaches Poll. Both rank the top 25 teams according to the aggregated expertise of sports writers and college football coaches. For the entire 2008 season (8/2008 { 1/2009), we compared the ranking of teams (top 10 and top 25) according to the polls with the rankings of one to eight URLs associated with each team in Google, Live Search and Yahoo. We found moderate to high correlations between the final rankings of 2007 and the SE ranking in mid 2008 but the correlation between the polls and the SEs steadily decreased as the season went on. We believe this is because the rankings in the web graph (as reported via SEs) have ""inertia"" and do not rapidly fluctuate as do the teams' on the field fortunes.",Proceedings of the 20th ACM conference on Hypertext and hypermedia,2009
905,134406,Query parameters for harvesting digital video and associated contextual information,Gary Marchionini,"Video is increasingly important to digital libraries and archives as both primary content and as context for the primary objects in collections. Services like YouTube not only offer large numbers of videos but also usage data such as comments and ratings that may help curators today make selections and aid future generations to interpret those selections. A query-based harvesting strategy is presented and results from daily harvests for six topics defined by 145 queries over a 20-month period are discussed with respect to, query specification parameters, topic, and contribution patterns. The limitations of the strategy and these data are considered and suggestions are offered for curators who wish to use query-based harvesting.",Proceedings of the 9th ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on Digital libraries,2009
905,63668,Critical methods and user generated content: the iPhone on YouTube,Mark Blythe,"Sites like YouTube offer vast sources of data for studies of human computer interaction. However, they also present a number of methodological challenges. This paper offers an example study of the initial reception of the iPhone 3G through YouTube. It begins with a quantitative account of the overall shape of the most frequently viewed returns for an iPhone 3G"" search. A content analysis of the first hundred videos then explores the returns categorized by genre. Comments on the most popular video ""Will It Blend""are analysed using grounded theory. It is argued that social science methods are not sufficient for a rich understanding of such material. The paper concludes with an analysis of""Will it Blend""that draws on cultural and critical theory. It is argued that a multi-methodological approach is necessary to exploit such data and also to address the challenges of next generation Human Computer Interaction (HCI).",Proceedings of the 27th international conference on Human factors in computing systems,2009

We examine information infrastructures in mid-sized urban slums of Mumbai and Bangalore in three ways--1) highlighting technologies supporting social networks, 2) examining underlying notions of trust and privacy in building information networks, and 3) discussing protocols and practices around shared access. We then discuss our thoughts on designing for low-income, low-literacy, and resource-challenged communities, presenting new ways to think about the design of ubiquitous technologies for international development. We argue for collaborative exchange between the established strengths of the Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) and Ubicomp communities to generate new ways of shaping technologies towards poverty alleviation in previously neglected socio-economic contexts--Ubicomp4D.",Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Ubiquitous computing,2009
962,66445,Designing digital games for rural children: a study of traditional village games in India,Matthew Kam,"Low educational levels hinder economic empowerment in developing countries. We make the case that educational games can impact children in the developing world. We report on exploratory studies with three communities in North and South India to show some problems with digital games that fail to match rural children's understanding of games, to highlight that there is much for us to learn about designing games that are culturally meaningful to them. We describe 28 traditional village games that they play, based on our contextual interviews. We analyze the mechanics in these games and compare these mechanics against existing videogames to show what makes traditional games unique. Our analysis has helped us to interpret the playability issues that we observed in our exploratory studies, and informed the design of a new videogame that rural children found to be more intuitive and engaging.",Proceedings of the 27th international conference on Human factors in computing systems,2009
962,493102,Form one students' engagement with computer games and its effect on their academic achievement in a Malaysian secondary school,Yee Leng Eow,"The main purpose of the study was to address the association between computer games and students' academic achievement. The exceptional growth in numbers of children playing computer games, the uneasiness and incomplete understanding foundation when starting the discussion on computer games have stimulated this study to be conducted. From a survey conducted on 236 form one students in one of the Malaysian secondary school, 75.8 percent were gamers. Playing computer games seemed to be more stereotypically boy's activity with 91.3 percent of the boys engaged in computer games compared to 54.1 percent among the girls. They spent an average of 8.47 hours per week playing computer games. Parents and teachers' concern about computer games was not something that went unwarranted as an overall result was predicting computer games as having negative associations with students' academic achievement. However, in-depth analyses by combinations of classes done step by step indicated that the initial results could be overruled by students from the last class, whom need extra attentions. As a conclusion, the findings in this study suggest some interesting yet ultimately weak associations between playing computer games and students' academic achievement. Nevertheless, caution is warranted in making any generalization as looking at the population as a whole will be different from its components. The generalizability of this study's findings is limited by the nature of the sample. Even so, blaming computer games for the students' bad academic performance in school is unjustified as there are many more other factors to look into before finding computer games as the scapegoat.",Computers Education,2009

The recommendations are based on aggregated information collected from various sources across the organization and are displayed in a widget, which is part of a popular enhanced employee directory. Recommended people are presented one by one, with detailed reasoning as for why they were recommended. Usage results are presented for a period of four months that indicate an extremely significant impact on the number of connections created in the system.

1052,496537,Overview based example selection in end user interactive concept learning,Saleema Amershi,"Interaction with large unstructured datasets is difficult because existing approaches, such as keyword search, are not always suited to describing concepts corresponding to the distinctions people want to make within datasets. One possible solution is to allow end users to train machine learning systems to identify desired concepts, a strategy known as interactive concept learning. A fundamental challenge is to design systems that preserve end user flexibility and control while also guiding them to provide examples that allow the machine learning system to effectively learn the desired concept. This paper presents our design and evaluation of four new overview based approaches to guiding example selection. We situate our explorations within CueFlik, a system examining end user interactive concept learning in Web image search. Our evaluation shows our approaches not only guide end users to select better training examples than the best performing previous design for this application, but also reduce the impact of not knowing when to stop training the system. We discuss challenges for end user interactive concept learning systems and identify opportunities for future research on the effective design of such systems.",Proceedings of the 22nd annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,2009

1146,65731,A hybrid probabilistic framework for content-based image retrieval with feature weighting,Djemel Ziou,"In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework for efficient retrieval and indexing of image collections. This framework uncovers the hierarchical structure underlying the collection from image features based on a hybrid model that combines both generative and discriminative learning. We adopt the generalized Dirichlet mixture and maximum likelihood for the generative learning in order to estimate accurately the statistical model of the data. Then, the resulting model is refined by a new discriminative likelihood that enhances the power of relevant features. Consequently, this new model is suitable for modeling high-dimensional data described by both semantic and low-level (visual) features. The semantic features are defined according to a known ontology while visual features represent the visual appearance such as color, shape, and texture. For validation purposes, we propose a new visual feature which has nice invariance properties to image transformations. Experiments on the Microsoft's collection (MSRCID) show clearly the merits of our approach in both retrieval and indexing.",Pattern Recognition,2009

A new discrete filled function is defined for max-cut problems and the properties of the filled function are studied. Unlike general filled function methods, using the characteristic of max-cut problems, the parameters in proposed filled function need not be adjusted. This greatly increases the efficiency of the filled function method. By combining a procedure that randomly generates initial points for minimization of the filled function, the proposed algorithm can greatly reduce the calculation cost and be applied to large scale max-cut problems. Numerical results on different sizes and densities test problems indicate that the proposed algorithm is efficient and stable to get approximate global solutions of max-cut problems.",Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics,2008

We have implemented some of these methods in the solvers rbfSolve and EGO in the TOMLAB Optimization Environment ( http://www.tomopt.com/tomlab/ ). In this paper we study algorithms based on RBF interpolation. The practical performance of the RBF algorithm is sensitive to the initial experimental design, and to the static choice of target values. A new adaptive radial basis interpolation (ARBF) algorithm, suitable for parallel implementation, is presented. The algorithm is described in detail and its efficiency is analyzed on the standard test problem set of Dixon---Szegö. Results show that it outperforms the published results of rbfSolve and several other solvers.",Journal of Global Optimization,2008
1149,307792,Nash q-learning for general-sum stochastic games,Junling Hu,"We extend Q-learning to a noncooperative multiagent context, using the framework of general-sum stochastic games. A learning agent maintains Q-functions over joint actions, and performs updates based on assuming Nash equilibrium behavior over the current Q-values. This learning protocol provably converges given certain restrictions on the stage games (defined by Q-values) that arise during learning. Experiments with a pair of two-player grid games suggest that such restrictions on the game structure are not necessarily required. Stage games encountered during learning in both grid environments violate the conditions. However, learning consistently converges in the first grid game, which has a unique equilibrium Q-function, but sometimes fails to converge in the second, which has three different equilibrium Q-functions. In a comparison of offline learning performance in both games, we find agents are more likely to reach a joint optimal path with Nash Q-learning than with a single-agent Q-learning method. When at least one agent adopts Nash Q-learning, the performance of both agents is better than using single-agent Q-learning. We have also implemented an online version of Nash Q-learning that balances exploration with exploitation, yielding improved performance.",The Journal of Machine Learning Research,2003

1149,567078,On market-inspired approaches to propositional satisfiability,William E. Walsh,"We describe three market-inspired approaches to propositional satisfiability. The first is based on a formulation of safisfiability as production on a supply chain, where producers of particular variable assignments must acquire licenses to fail to satisfy particular clauses. Experiments show that although this general supply-chain protocol can converge to market allocations corresponding to satisfiable truth assignments, it is impractically slow. We find that a simplified market structure and a variation on the pricing method can improve performance significantly. We compare the performance of the three market-based protocols with distributed breakout algorithm and GSAT on benchmark 3-SAT problems. We identify a tradeoff between performance and economic realism in the market protocols, and a tradeoff between performance and the degree of decentralization between the market protocols and distributed breakout. We also conduct informal and experimental analyses to gain insight into the operation of price-guided search.",Artificial Intelligence,2003

1149,439685,Emergent Properties of a Market-based Digital Library with Strategic Agents,Sunju Park,"The University of Michigan Digital Library (UMDL) is designed as an open system that allows third parties to build and integrate their own profit-seeking agents into the marketplace of information goods and services. The profit-seeking behavior of agents, however, risks inefficient allocation of goods and services, as agents take strategic stances that might backfire. While it would be good if we could impose mechanisms to remove incentives for strategic reasoning, this is not possible in the UMDL. Therefore, our approach has instead been to study whether encouraging the other extreme&mdash;making strategic reasoning ubiquitous&mdash;provides an answer.Toward this end, we have designed a strategy (called the p-strategy) that uses a stochastic model of the market to find the best offer price. We have then examined the collective behavior of p-strategy agents in the UMDL auction. Our experiments show that strategic thinking is not always beneficial and that the advantage of being strategic decreases with the arrival of equally strategic agents. Furthermore, a simpler strategy can be as effective when enough other agents use the p-strategy. Consequently, we expect the UMDL is likely to evolve to a point where some agents use simpler strategies and some use the p-strategy.",Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems,2000

This method moves from one discrete minimizer of the objective function f to another better one at each iteration with the help of an auxiliary function, entitled the discrete global descent function. The discrete global descent function guarantees that its discrete minimizers coincide with the better discrete minimizers of f under some standard assumptions. This property also ensures that a better discrete minimizer of f can be found by some classical local search methods.

1197,508047,Investigating virtual passthrough I/O on commodity devices,Lei Xia,"A commodity I/O device has no support for virtualization. A VMM can assign such a device to a single guest with direct, fast, but insecure access by the guest's native device driver. Alternatively, the VMMcan build virtual devices on top of the physical device, allowing it to be multiplexed across VMs, but with lower performance. We propose a technique that provides an intermediate option. In virtual passthrough I/O (VPIO), the guest interacts directly with the physical device most of the time, achieving high performance, as in passthrough I/O. Additionally, the guest/device interactions drive a model that in turn identifies (1) when the physical device can be handed off to another VM, and (2) if the guest programs the device to behave illegitimately. In this paper, we describe the VPIO model, and present preliminary results in using it to support two commodity network cards within the Palacios VMM we are building. We believe that an appropriate model for an I/O device could be produced by the hardware vendor as part of the design, implementation, and testing process.",ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review,2009

The motivation for this analysis is a quest for ways to engage a broader spectrum of expertise in state-of-the-art petascale modeling activities. Current generation petascale efforts are based around massively parallel systems with greater than 50,000 cores. This presents a considerable challenge to typical computational science and engineering application analysis and development practices. To illustrate the challenge we examine an ocean model deployed on a recently commissioned &ap;60,000 core parallel system. This case study demonstrates interesting science and engineering challenges that many advanced simulations on petascale systems will face.

1197,58545,GViM: GPU-accelerated virtual machines,Vishakha Gupta,"The use of virtualization to abstract underlying hardware can aid in sharing such resources and in efficiently managing their use by high performance applications. Unfortunately, virtualization also prevents efficient access to accelerators, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), that have become critical components in the design and architecture of HPC systems. Supporting General Purpose computing on GPUs (GPGPU) with accelerators from different vendors presents significant challenges due to proprietary programming models, heterogeneity, and the need to share accelerator resources between different Virtual Machines (VMs). To address this problem, this paper presents GViM, a system designed for virtualizing and managing the resources of a general purpose system accelerated by graphics processors. Using the NVIDIA GPU as an example, we discuss how such accelerators can be virtualized without additional hardware support and describe the basic extensions needed for resource management. Our evaluation with a Xen-based implementation of GViM demonstrate efficiency and flexibility in system usage coupled with only small performance penalties for the virtualized vs. non-virtualized solutions.",Proceedings of the 3rd ACM Workshop on System-level Virtualization for High Performance Computing,2009

For trusted data paths, runtime protection methods control what data is visible to which distributed services operating on it, guided by online monitoring that determines the levels of trust inherent in the paths' machines, services, and service actions. This paper presents a key functional element of trusted data paths, which is the ProtectIT interception mechanism for controlling the data exchanges between the different virtual machines running trusted services. ProtectIT can be applied to any communication and/or I/O performed by virtual machines, and because ProtectIT does not require application, middleware, or operating system modifications, it can be used to construct trusted data paths without the knowledge or consent of such entities. Further, since ProtectIT operates in virtual machines isolated from those used by applications, it is not subject to the attacks faced by services exposed to the open Internet. ProtectIT's functionality consists of dynamic protection rules represented as data filters applied to virtual machines' communications. Examples presented in this paper include email services for which ProtectIT's filters control data visibility to mail servers and clients, and unsecured virtual machine communications morphed into secure ones via ProtectIT-based message interception.",ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review,2008
1197,59268,Achieving 10 Gb/s using safe and transparent network interface virtualization,Kaushik Kumar Ram,"This paper presents mechanisms and optimizations to reduce the overhead of network interface virtualization when using the driver domain I/O virtualization model. The driver domain model provides benefits such as support for legacy device drivers and fault isolation. However, the processing overheads incurred in the driver domain to achieve these benefits limit overall I/O performance. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of two approaches to reduce driver domain overheads. First, Xen is modified to support multi-queue network interfaces to eliminate the software overheads of packet demultiplexing and copying. Second, a grant reuse mechanism is developed to reduce memory protection overheads. These mechanisms shift the bottleneck from the driver domain to the guest domains, improving scalability and enabling significantly higher data rates. This paper also presents and evaluates a series of optimizations that substantially reduce the I/O virtualization overheads in the guest domain. In combination, these mechanisms and optimizations increase the maximum throughput achieved by guest domains from 2.9Gb/s to full 10 Gigabit Ethernet link rates.",Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGPLAN/SIGOPS international conference on Virtual execution environments,2009
1197,63717,The hybrid scheduling framework for virtual machine systems,Chuliang Weng,"The virtualization technology makes it feasible that multiple guest operating systems run on a single physical machine. It is the virtual machine monitor that dynamically maps the virtual CPU of virtual machines to physical CPUs according to the scheduling strategy. The scheduling strategy in Xen schedules virtual CPUs of a virtual machines asynchronously while guarantees the proportion of the CPU time corresponding to its weight, maximizing the throughput of the system. However, this scheduling strategy may deteriorate the performance when the virtual machine is used to execute the concurrent applications such as parallel programs or multithreaded programs. In this paper, we analyze the CPU scheduling problem in the virtual machine monitor theoretically, and the result is that the asynchronous CPU scheduling strategy will waste considerable physical CPU time when the system workload is the concurrent application. Then, we present a hybrid scheduling framework for the CPU scheduling in the virtual machine monitor. There are two types of virtual machines in the system: the high-throughput type and the concurrent type. The virtual machine can be set as the concurrent type when the majority of its workload is concurrent applications in order to reduce the cost of synchronization. Otherwise, it is set as the high-throughput type as the default. Moreover, we implement the hybrid scheduling framework based on Xen, and we will give a description of our implementation in details. At last, we test the performance of the presented scheduling framework and strategy based on the multi-core platform, and the experiment result indicates that the scheduling framework and strategy is feasible to improve the performance of the virtual machine system.",Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGPLAN/SIGOPS international conference on Virtual execution environments,2009
1197,67462,IBMon: monitoring VMM-bypass capable InfiniBand devices using memory introspection,Adit Ranadive,"Active monitoring of virtual machine (VM) behaviors and their utilization of different resource types is critical for effective management of high end cluster machines, data centers, and cloud computing infrastructures. Unfortunately, for reasons of performance, certain types of existing and future devices support capabilities that provide VMs with direct access to device resources, thereby bypassing the virtual machine monitor (VMM). This presents significant challenges to the VMM due to its resulting inability to assess VMdevice interactions. This paper describes a monitoring utility, IBMon, which enables the asynchronous monitoring of virtualized Infini-Band devices -- a sample VMM-bypass device heavily used in the HPC community. In the absence of adequate hardware supported monitoring information, IBMon uses dynamic memory introspection techniques to infer information regarding the VM-device interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that IBMon can asynchronously monitor VMM-bypass operations with acceptable accuracy, and negligible overheads, including for larger number of VMs, and for VMs with dynamic behavior patterns.",Proceedings of the 3rd ACM Workshop on System-level Virtualization for High Performance Computing,2009

1205,142340,Efficient argumentation over ontology correspondences,Paul Doran,"The ability to communicate is one of the key capabilities of an agent within a Multi-Agent System. In open environments, where agents are likely to use heterogeneous ontologies, it is necessary to use formally defined ontologies [1] to support communication. However, this requires either a shared ontology, or a set of correspondences (alignment) that map semantically related entities from one ontology to another. The open nature of such environments results in this being unlikely due to few a priori assumptions being made about the agents present; thus requiring techniques for dynamic alignment and reconciliation. To dynamically reconcile heterogeneous ontologies, agents need to be able to agree on an acceptable alignment between their ontologies. Various approaches attempt to resolve ontological mismatches in open environments [8, 4], using negotiation approaches that search the space of alignments to find a mutually acceptable set of correspondences. However, this search can become prohibitively costly when negotiation mechanisms such as argumentation are involved, reaching II(p)2-complete [5]. Hence, it is important to reduce the search space before the argumentation process takes place. The Meaning-based Argumentation approach [8] allows two agents to dynamically and automatically reach consensus by arguing over a set of candidate mappings (or correspondences) obtained from a mapping repository. We have explored the use of Ontology Modularization as a filtering mechanism for reducing the number of candidate mappings, by isolating only those mappings that are relevant to the communication, and hence reducing the size of the search space for the argumentation process.",Proceedings of The 8th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems - Volume 2,2009

1228,47363,An efficient delegation protocol with delegation traceability in the X.509 proxy certificate environment for computational grids,Younho Lee,"The X.509 proxy certificate is widely used to delegate an entity's right to another entity in the computational grid environment. However, this proxy certificate has two drawbacks: the potential security threat caused by non-traceability of a delegation chain and the inefficiency caused by an interactive communication between the right grantor and the right grantee on the delegation protocol. To address these problems, a new delegation protocol is presented. The proposed protocol employs an ID-based key generation technique to support delegation traceability and non-interactive delegation. Since access-right delegation occurs frequently in the computational grid environment, the proposed protocol can enhance security by providing delegation traceability and can enhance efficiency by reducing the inter-domain communication cost.",Information Sciences: an International Journal,2008

1263,493102,Form one students' engagement with computer games and its effect on their academic achievement in a Malaysian secondary school,Yee Leng Eow,"The main purpose of the study was to address the association between computer games and students' academic achievement. The exceptional growth in numbers of children playing computer games, the uneasiness and incomplete understanding foundation when starting the discussion on computer games have stimulated this study to be conducted. From a survey conducted on 236 form one students in one of the Malaysian secondary school, 75.8 percent were gamers. Playing computer games seemed to be more stereotypically boy's activity with 91.3 percent of the boys engaged in computer games compared to 54.1 percent among the girls. They spent an average of 8.47 hours per week playing computer games. Parents and teachers' concern about computer games was not something that went unwarranted as an overall result was predicting computer games as having negative associations with students' academic achievement. However, in-depth analyses by combinations of classes done step by step indicated that the initial results could be overruled by students from the last class, whom need extra attentions. As a conclusion, the findings in this study suggest some interesting yet ultimately weak associations between playing computer games and students' academic achievement. Nevertheless, caution is warranted in making any generalization as looking at the population as a whole will be different from its components. The generalizability of this study's findings is limited by the nature of the sample. Even so, blaming computer games for the students' bad academic performance in school is unjustified as there are many more other factors to look into before finding computer games as the scapegoat.",Computers Education,2009

Specifically, we consider here type inference and type checking for queries over BP execution traces. The queries that we consider select portions of the traces that are of interest to the user; the types describe the possible shape of the execution traces in the input/output of the query. We formally define and characterize here three common classes of BP execution traces and their respective notions of type inference and type checking. We study the complexity of the two problems for query languages of varying expressive power and present efficient type inference/checking algorithms whenever possible. Our analysis offers a nearly complete picture of which combinations of trace classes and query features lead to PTIME algorithms and which to NP-complete or undecidable problems.",Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008

A microscopic agent-based model accounts for spatiality and serves as a baseline for assessing the accuracy of models at higher abstraction level. Spatiality is relaxed in Monte Carlo simulations, which still capture the binding energy of each individual aggregate. Finally, we introduce a macroscopic model that only keeps track of the average number of aggregates in each energy state. This model is able to quantitatively and qualitatively predict the dynamics observed at lower, more detailed modeling levels. Since we investigate an idealized system, thus making very few assumptions about the exact nature of the final target system, our framework is potentially applicable to a large body of self-assembling agents ranging from functional micro-robots endowed with simple sensors and actuators to elementary microfabricated parts. In particular, we show how our suite of models at different abstraction levels can be used for optimizing both the design of the building blocks and the control of the stochastic process.",Proceedings of The 8th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems - Volume 1,2009
1462,73054,Hierarchical fuzzy rule based classification systems with genetic rule selection for imbalanced data-sets,Alberto Fernández,"In many real application areas, the data used are highly skewed and the number of instances for some classes are much higher than that of the other classes. Solving a classification task using such an imbalanced data-set is difficult due to the bias of the training towards the majority classes. The aim of this paper is to improve the performance of fuzzy rule based classification systems on imbalanced domains, increasing the granularity of the fuzzy partitions on the boundary areas between the classes, in order to obtain a better separability. We propose the use of a hierarchical fuzzy rule based classification system, which is based on the refinement of a simple linguistic fuzzy model by means of the extension of the structure of the knowledge base in a hierarchical way and the use of a genetic rule selection process in order to get a compact and accurate model. The good performance of this approach is shown through an extensive experimental study carried out over a large collection of imbalanced data-sets.",International Journal of Approximate Reasoning,2009

The observed insect behavior, in the context of the insect's sensor-actor system, is formalized as behavioral and motion-sensing meta-models. These meta-models are transformed into a sensor-actor system of micro-robots by means of a sensors virtualization technique. This allows us to keep the efficiency and scalability of the bio-inspired approach. We also demonstrate the systematic character of this re-embodiment procedure on collective aggregation in a real robotic swarm.","Adaptive Behavior - Animals, Animats, Software Agents, Robots, Adaptive Systems",2009
1462,58467,Self-Organized Aggregation Triggers Collective Decision Making in a Group of Cockroach-Like Robots,Simon Garnier,"Self-amplification processes are at the origin of several collective decision phenomena in insect societies. Understanding these processes requires linking individual behavioral rules of insects to a choice dynamics at the colony level. In a homogeneous environment, the German cockroach Blattella germanica displays self-amplified aggregation behavior. In a heterogeneous environment where several shelters are present, groups of cockroaches collectively select one of them. In this article, we demonstrate that the restriction of the self-amplified aggregation behavior to distinct zones in the environment can explain the emergence of a collective decision at the level of the group. This hypothesis is tested with robotics experiments and dedicated computer simulations. We show that the collective decision is influenced by the available spaces to explore and to aggregate in, by the size of the population involved in the aggregation process and by the probability of encounter zones while the robots explore the environment. We finally discuss these results from both a biological and a robotics point of view.","Adaptive Behavior - Animals, Animats, Software Agents, Robots, Adaptive Systems",2009

The main novelty of the algorithm is that both rule base and granularity of the uniform partitions defined on the input and output variables are learned concurrently. To this aim, we introduce the concepts of virtual and concrete rule bases: the former is defined on linguistic variables, all partitioned with a fixed maximum number of fuzzy sets, while the latter takes into account, for each variable, a number of fuzzy sets as determined by the specific partition granularity of that variable. We exploit a chromosome composed of two parts, which codify the variables partition granularities, and the virtual rule base, respectively. Genetic operators manage virtual rule bases, whereas fitness evaluation relies on an appropriate mapping strategy between virtual and concrete rule bases. The algorithm has been tested on two real-world regression problems showing very promising results.",International Journal of Approximate Reasoning,2009

This paper proposes an SPI implementation strategy that has been developed in lines with standard SPI models and frameworks, intended to be suitable for global software development (GSD), and exploiting ideas of incremental deliveries, short iterations with frequent reviews and close collaboration with customers. Quantitative analyses of data from case studies within large GSD show that improvement teams implementing the strategy are more likely to have better progress and achieve better effectiveness in terms of improvement deployment within development teams. The results could be useful to SPI practitioners in making their SPI initiatives more successful.",Information and Software Technology,2009

1547,135263,Does distributed development affect software quality? An empirical case study of Windows Vista,Christian Bird,"It is widely believed that distributed software development is riskier and more challenging than collocated development. Prior literature on distributed development in software engineering and other fields discuss various challenges, including cultural barriers, expertise transfer difficulties, and communication and coordination overhead. We evaluate this conventional belief by examining the overall development of Windows Vista and comparing the post-release failures of components that were developed in a distributed fashion with those that were developed by collocated teams. We found a negligible difference in failures. This difference becomes even less significant when controlling for the number of developers working on a binary. We also examine component characteristics such as code churn, complexity, dependency information, and test code coverage and find very little difference between distributed and collocated components to investigate if less complex components are more distributed. Further, we examine the software process and phenomena that occurred during the Vista development cycle and present ways in which the development process utilized may be insensitive to geography by mitigating the difficulties introduced in prior work in this area.",Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE 31st International Conference on Software Engineering,2009
1547,627515,Latent social structure in open source projects,Christian Bird,"Commercial software project managers design project organizational structure carefully, mindful of available skills, division of labour, geographical boundaries, etc. These organizational ""cathedrals"" are to be contrasted with the ""bazaar-like"" nature of Open Source Software (OSS) Projects, which have no pre-designed organizational structure. Any structure that exists is dynamic, self-organizing, latent, and usually not explicitly stated. Still, in large, complex, successful, OSS projects, we do expect that subcommunities will form spontaneously within the developer teams. Studying these subcommunities, and their behavior can shed light on how successful OSS projects self-organize. This phenomenon could well hold important lessons for how commercial software teams might be organized. Building on known well-established techniques for detecting community structure in complex networks, we extract and study latent subcommunities from the email social network of several projects: Apache HTTPD, Python, PostgresSQL, Perl, and Apache ANT. We then validate them with software development activity history. Our results show that subcommunities do indeed spontaneously arise within these projects as the projects evolve. These subcommunities manifest most strongly in technical discussions, and are significantly connected with collaboration behaviour.",Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Foundations of software engineering,2008
1547,415468,Software Design and Architecture The once and future focus of software engineering,Richard N. Taylor,"The design of software has been a focus of software engineering research since the field's beginning. This paper explores key aspects of this research focus and shows why design will remain a principal focus. The intrinsic elements of software design, both process and product, are discussed: concept formation, use of experience, and means for representation, reasoning, and directing the design activity. Design is presented as being an activity engaged by a wide range of stakeholders, acting throughout most of a system's lifecycle, making a set of key choices which constitute the application's architecture. Directions for design research are outlined, including: (a) drawing lessons, inspiration, and techniques from design fields outside of computer science, (b) emphasizing the design of application ""character"" (functionality and style) as well as the application's structure, and (c) expanding the notion of software to encompass the design of additional kinds of intangible complex artifacts.",2007 Future of Software Engineering,2007
1547,61428,Evolving an infrastructure for student global software development projects: lessons for industry,Olly Gotel,"With the rapid increase in offshore outsourcing of software development, Global Software Development (GSD) has become the need of the hour. Today's information technology, in the form of communication networks and tooling opportunities, provides us with a supposedly ready infrastructure to support GSD. However, selecting an appropriate combination of tools that cross cultural boundaries and account for unique in-country connectivity situations is not a trivial task. In this paper, we describe our experience of evolving an infrastructure for student GSD projects over a period of four years, culminating in an environment to accommodate the needs of five different teams from four globally dispersed universities in countries straddling many technological divides. We suggest that our experience offers lessons that can also support those organizations embarking upon GSD initiatives and with their own infrastructure decisions to make.",Proceedings of the 2nd India software engineering conference,2009

First, we overview the state of the art in RE research. The research is considered with respect to technologies developed to address specific requirements tasks, such as elicitation, modeling, and analysis. Such a review enables us to identify mature areas of research, as well as areas that warrant further investigation. Next, we review several strategies for performing and extending RE research results, to help delineate the scope of future research directions. Finally, we highlight what we consider to be the ""hot"" current and future research topics, which aim to address RE needs for emerging systems of the future.",2007 Future of Software Engineering,2007

1577,66901,Demystifying magic: high-level low-level programming,Daniel Frampton,"The power of high-level languages lies in their abstraction over hardware and software complexity, leading to greater security, better reliability, and lower development costs. However, opaque abstractions are often show-stoppers for systems programmers, forcing them to either break the abstraction, or more often, simply give up and use a different language. This paper addresses the challenge of opening up a high-level language to allow practical low-level programming without forsaking integrity or performance. The contribution of this paper is three-fold: 1) we draw together common threads in a diverse literature, 2) we identify a framework for extending high-level languages for low-level programming, and 3) we show the power of this approach through concrete case studies. Our framework leverages just three core ideas: extending semantics via intrinsic methods, extending types via unboxing and architectural-width primitives, and controlling semantics via scoped semantic regimes. We develop these ideas through the context of a rich literature and substantial practical experience. We show that they provide the power necessary to implement substantial artifacts such as a high-performance virtual machine, while preserving the software engineering benefits of the host language. The time has come for high-level low-level programming to be taken more seriously: 1) more projects now use high-level languages for systems programming, 2) increasing architectural heterogeneity and parallelism heighten the need for abstraction, and 3) a new generation of high-level languages are under development and ripe to be influenced.",Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGPLAN/SIGOPS international conference on Virtual execution environments,2009
1577,42204,Fair stateless model checking,Madanlal Musuvathi,"Stateless model checking is a useful state-space exploration technique for systematically testing complex real-world software. Existing stateless model checkers are limited to the verification of safety properties on terminating programs. However, realistic concurrent programs are nonterminating, a property that significantly reduces the efficacy of stateless model checking in testing them. Moreover, existing stateless model checkers are unable to verify that a nonterminating program satisfies the important liveness property of livelock-freedom, a property that requires the program to make continuous progress for any input. To address these shortcomings, this paper argues for incorporating a fair scheduler in stateless exploration. The key contribution of this paper is an explicit scheduler that is (strongly) fair and at the same time sufficiently nondeterministic to guarantee full coverage of safety properties.We have implemented the fair scheduler in the CHESS model checker. We show through theoretical arguments and empirical evaluation that our algorithm satisfies two important properties: 1) it visits all states of a finite-state program achieving state coverage at a faster rate than existing techniques, and 2) it finds all livelocks in a finite-state program. Before this work, nonterminating programs had to be manually modified in order to apply CHESS to them. The addition of fairness has allowed CHESS to be effectively applied to real-world nonterminating programs without any modification. For example, we have successfully booted the Singularity operating system under the control of CHESS.",ACM SIGPLAN Notices,2008
1577,71955,Dingo: taming device drivers,Leonid Ryzhyk,"Device drivers are notorious for being a major source of failure in operating systems. In analysing a sample of real defects in Linux drivers, we found that a large proportion (39%) of bugs are due to two key shortcomings in the device-driver architecture enforced by current operating systems: poorly-defined communication protocols between drivers and the OS, which confuse developers and lead to protocol violations, and a multithreaded model of computation that leads to numerous race conditions and deadlocks. We claim that a better device driver architecture can help reduce the occurrence of these faults, and present our Dingo framework as constructive proof. Dingo provides a formal, state-machine based, language for describing driver protocols, which avoids confusion and ambiguity, and helps driver writers implement correct behaviour. It also enforces an event-driven model of computation, which eliminates most concurrency-related faults. Our implementation of the Dingo architecture in Linux offers these improvements, while introducing negligible performance overhead. It allows Dingo and native Linux drivers to coexist, providing a gradual migration path to more reliable device drivers.",Proceedings of the 4th ACM European conference on Computer systems,2009
1577,433019,Sealing OS processes to improve dependability and safety,Galen Hunt,"In most modern operating systems, a process is a hardware-protected abstraction for isolating code and data. This protection, however, is selective. Many common mechanisms---dynamic code loading, run-time code generation, shared memory, and intrusive system APIs---make the barrier between processes very permeable. This paper argues that this traditional open process architecture exacerbates the dependability and security weaknesses of modern systems. As a remedy, this paper proposes a sealed process architecture, which prohibits dynamic code loading, self-modifying code, shared memory, and limits the scope of the process API. This paper describes the implementation of the sealed process architecture in the Singularity operating system, discusses its merits and drawbacks, and evaluates its effectiveness. Some benefits of this sealed process architecture are: improved program analysis by tools, stronger security and safety guarantees, elimination of redundant overlaps between the OS and language runtimes, and improved software engineering. Conventional wisdom says open processes are required for performance; our experience suggests otherwise. We present the first macrobenchmarks for a sealed-process operating system and applications. The benchmarks show that an experimental sealed-process system can achieve performance competitive with highly-tuned, commercial, open-process systems.",Proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGOPS/EuroSys European Conference on Computer Systems 2007,2007
1577,501646,Robustly secure computer systems: a new security paradigm of system discontinuity,Jon A. Solworth,"For over 30 years, system software has been bound by compatibility with legacy applications. The system software base, whether proprietary or open source, is dominated by the programming language C and the POSIX operating system specification. Even when commercial operating systems stray from this model, they don't go very far. Unfortunately, the POSIX/C base was constructed in a more benign environment than today and before many security issues were widely understood. Rather than fix these issues, compatibility has been deemed more important than security, and so this base has been kept intact with all its flaws. As a result, programmers routinely create software with security holes---even in the most security critical software---and today's systems are easily attacked. We propose a new paradigm of system discontinuity which emphasizes security over compatibility by removing those constructs in our system software which lead to security holes in applications. Of course, removing parts of the interface will break applications, and hence the discontinuity. To deal with this situation, we advocate the use of virtual machines to enable multiple operating systems to run concurrently. Thus high security OSs can be used for the most security sensitive applications. Compatibility is maintained for less security sensitive applications using legacy operating systems. Over time, legacy applications can migrate to a more secure OS, thus raising the security of all applications.",Proceedings of the 2007 Workshop on New Security Paradigms,2008
1577,51588,Formalising device driver interfaces,Leonid Ryzhyk,The lack of well-defined protocols for interaction with the operating system is a common source of defects in device drivers. In this paper we investigate the use of a formal language to define these protocols unambiguously. We present a language that allows us to convey all important requirements for driver behaviour in a compact specification and that can be readily understood by software engineers. It is intended to close the communication gap between OS and driver developers and enable more reliable device drivers.,Proceedings of the 4th workshop on Programming languages and operating systems,2007

1721,64860,"Introduction: Multimodal communication in animals, humans and robots: An introduction to perspectives in brain-inspired informatics",S. Wermter,"Recent years have seen convergence in research on brain mechanisms and neurocomputational approaches, culminating in the creation of a new generation of robots whose artificial ""brains"" respect neuroscience principles and whose ""cognitive"" systems venture into higher cognitive domains such as planning and action sequencing, complex object and concept processing, and language. The present article gives an overview of selected projects in this general multidisciplinary field. The work reviewed centres on research funded by the EU in the context of the New and Emergent Science and Technology, NEST, funding scheme highlighting the topic ""What it means to be human"". Examples of such projects include learning by imitation (Edici project), examining the origin of human rule-based reasoning (Far), studying the neural origins of language (Neurocom), exploring the evolutionary origins of the human mind (Pkb140404), researching into verbal and non-verbal communication (Refcom), using and interpreting signs (Sedsu), characterising human language by structural complexity (Chlasc), and representing abstract concepts (Abstract). Each of the communication-centred research projects revealed individual insights; however, there had been little overall analysis of results and hypotheses. In the Specific Support Action Nestcom, we proposed to analyse some NEST projects focusing on the central question ""What it means to communicate"" and to review, understand and integrate the results of previous communication-related research, in order to develop and communicate multimodal experimental hypotheses for investigation by future projects. The present special issue includes a range of papers on the interplay between neuroinformatics, brain science and robotics in the general area of higher cognitive functions and multimodal communication. These papers extend talks given at the NESTCOM workshops, at ICANN (http://www.his.sunderland.ac.uk/nestcom/workshop/icann.html) in Porto and at the first meeting of the Federation of the European Societies of Neuropsychology in Edinburgh in 2008 (http://www.his.sunderland.ac.uk/nestcom/workshop/esn.html).

The interface presents a task-based bioinformatics analysis protocol detailing the functional analysis of a gene sequence, a complex information task that is problematic for many biologists. The interface guides the user through a series of 14 analytical steps, providing details on why to follow the step, what data is input/output, what tool(s) to use and how to interpret the results. It provides the framework and support within which the user can accomplish the information task.

1732,43743,Some(what) grand challenges for information retrieval,Nicholas J. Belkin,"Although we see the positive results of information retrieval research embodied throughout the Internet, on our computer desktops, and in many other aspects of daily life, at the same time we notice that people still have a wide variety of difficulties in finding information that is useful in resolving their problematic situations. This suggests that there still remain substantial challenges for research in IR. Already in 1988, on the occasion of receiving the ACM SIGIR Gerard Salton Award, Karen Sp&auml;rck Jones suggested that substantial progress in information retrieval was likely only to come through addressing issues associated with users (actual or potential) of IR systems, rather than continuing IR research's almost exclusive focus on document representation and matching and ranking techniques. In recent years it appears that her message has begun to be heard, yet we still have relatively few substantive results that respond to it. In this paper, I identify and discuss a few challenges for IR research which fall within the scope of association with users, and which I believe, if properly addressed, are likely to lead to substantial increases in the usefulness, usability and pleasurability of information retrieval.",ACM SIGIR Forum,2008

In the context of K-12 educational libraries this means that we must understand how K-12 teachers interact with such libraries and how they assess the relevance of documents found or encountered. This paper presents the results of an experiment in which K-12 teachers scored the relevance of curriculum they found themselves and the relevance of documents their colleagues found and recommended. We found that teachers apply a significantly more detailed notion of relevance, both qualitatively and quantitatively, when searching for as compared to evaluating recommended curricula. Differences were observed in both relevance judgments and system interaction logs. These variations may be useful in identifying user intent and in dynamically adapting the behavior of digital libraries of educational material.",Proceedings of the 9th ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on Digital libraries,2009
1732,42748,Exploring educational standard alignment: in search of 'relevance',René Reitsma,"The growing availability of online K-12 curriculum is increasing the need for meaningful alignment of this curriculum with state-specific standards. Promising automated and semi-automated alignment tools have recently become available. Unfortunately, recent alignment evaluation studies report low inter-rater reliability, e.g., 32% with two raters and 35 documents. While these results are in line with studies in other domains, low reliability makes it difficult to accurately train automatic systems and complicates comparison of different services. We propose that inter-rater reliability of broadly defined, abstract concepts such as 'alignment' or 'relevance' must be expected to be low due to the real-world complexity of teaching and the multidimensional nature of the curricular documents. Hence, we suggest decomposing these concepts into less abstract, more precise measures anchored in the daily practice of teaching. This article reports on the integration of automatic alignment results into the interface of the Teach Engineering collection and on an evaluation methodology intended to produce more consistent document relevance ratings. Our results (based on 14 raters x 6 documents) show high inter-rater reliability (61 - 95%) on less abstract relevance dimensions while scores on the overall 'relevance' concept are (as expected) lower (64%).

From the analysis of the literature a taxonomy was built and it is used to structure the paper. Information Retrieval (IR) is presented from different points of view: technical levels, educational goals, teaching and learning methods, assessment and curricula. The review is organized around two levels of abstraction which form a taxonomy that deals with the different aspects of pedagogy as applied to information retrieval. The first level looks at the technical level of delivering information retrieval concepts, and at the educational goals as articulated by the two main subject domains where IR is delivered: computer science (CS) and library and information science (LIS). The second level focuses on pedagogical issues, such as teaching and learning methods, delivery modes (classroom, online or e-learning), use of IR systems for teaching, assessment and feedback, and curricula design. The survey, and its bibliography, provides an overview of the pedagogical research carried out in the field of IR. It also provides a guide for educators on approaches that can be applied to improving the student learning experiences.",Information Retrieval,2009

1761,61003,Key hierarchies for hierarchical access control in secure group communications,Junzhi Yan,"The problem of hierarchical access control in secure group communications has elicited much interest in the literatures. However, most of the researches to date on hierarchical access control pay more attention to the particular encryption techniques, but considered little about the features of key hierarchies. In hierarchical access control systems, keys are usually organized hierarchically. We analyze the user-based, resource-based and unified key hierarchies in this paper. The first two hierarchies are established from the access matrix. By unifying these two hierarchies, we get the unified key hierarchy. Furthermore, we introduce the explicit accessible set and the explicit dominating set to describe the key distributions for these hierarchies, and prove that the unified key hierarchy can be formed from the explicit dominating sets in the user-based key hierarchy or the explicit accessible sets in the resource-based key hierarchy. To evaluate the efficiency of the described key hierarchies, we combine these hierarchies with the existing key assignment models and analyze their storage and rekey overheads. These overheads can be derived from the access matrix, and the derivation procedure is described. The conclusions of this paper can help to establish a suitable key hierarchy so as to make the key assignment scheme more efficient in practical applications.",Computer Networks: The International Journal of Computer and Telecommunications Networking,2009

The simulation of construction operations has been a growing field of research over the last several decades. Since the introduction of the first simulation system, which was based on the activity cycle diagram paradigm of modeling, numerous additional tools have been introduced, each building on and expanding the modeling and analytical capabilities of previous approaches. However, despite such rich body of knowledge, which by now is expanding into areas such as visualization, animation, and virtual reality applications for construction project management, the beneficial application of simulation in practice has been marginal. This paper describes both historical and practical reasons for this situation and presents an ontology-based approach that can harness existing information in construction project management, especially the scheduling function, and has the potential to significantly improve its operational planning and optimization.",Proceedings of the 40th Conference on Winter Simulation,2008
